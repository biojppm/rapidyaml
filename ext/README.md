# External source files

All the source files under this folder are from external projects; they are explicitly copied into rapidyaml to avoid use of git submodules, which some users prefer to avoid.

There is a [./Makefile](Makefile) to help manage the workflow to modify these files. (If you work in Windows, and a make executable is not available, you can [install one on the git bash bin directory](https://gist.github.com/evanwill/0207876c3243bbb6863e65ec5dc3f058), for example.)
